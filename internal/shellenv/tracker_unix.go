//
// The value trades leak coverage against cost. One tick is one `ps` invocation
// for the whole process, no matter how many leaders are registered, so 15s is
// cheap even under a full pipeline. The residual gap is a process that both
// spawns and loses its parent inside a single tick; nothing short of ptrace or a
// PID namespace closes that. For calibration, the six xctest processes from gate
// run 01KY36EAXX53WZSEC4ZYSMY4F0 lived about 16 minutes, so they would have been
// sampled roughly 60 times.

// trackerFirstSample bounds how long a leader can run before it is sampled at
// all. It is much shorter than trackerTick because the first sample is the one
// that decides whether an early-cancelled command is reapable.
//
// It applies to every leader, not only the one that started the poller. A daemon
// running a long agent step keeps a poller alive for the whole run, so the
// ordinary case is a command registering while sampling is already in progress;
// leaving it to wait out a full trackerTick would leave a command cancelled a
// few seconds in with an empty union and its escapees unreachable, which is the
// leak this package exists to close.
