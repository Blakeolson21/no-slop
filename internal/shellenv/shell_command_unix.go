// defaultWaitDelay is the pipe backstop installed on cmd.WaitDelay, mirroring
// the Windows helper. After a cancelled command's leader is signalled, a
// grandchild that inherited and still holds open the leader's stdout/stderr
// pipe would otherwise wedge cmd.Wait (and any in-flight pipe Read) forever.
// A nonzero WaitDelay lets the exec package close those inherited pipes and
// return instead of blocking. It is a worst-case ceiling only: on a clean exit
// the pipes close immediately and Wait returns without waiting.
const defaultWaitDelay = 5 * time.Second

// ConfigureShellCommand isolates cmd in its own process group (Setpgid) and
// installs a cmd.Cancel that reaps the resulting process tree when cmd's context
// is cancelled. exec.CommandContext otherwise only kills the direct child PID,
// leaving grandchildren (a test runner's worker processes, an agent-spawned
// git/build/editor) running and holding the worktree locked.
//
// A process group is not a process tree, and the difference is not academic. A
// descendant that calls setsid() gets its own session and its own group, so
// kill(-leaderPID) provably cannot reach it - and setsid() is what Node's
// `detached: true` does, which is how Claude Code's CLI Bash tool spawns its
// shell. Reaching those descendants needs the ppid walk in internal/proctree,
// which reapProcessTree performs alongside the group kill.
//
// Cancellation is only half the lifecycle: cmd.Cancel never fires when the
// command exits on its own (success or failure). Use RunShellCommand,
// OutputShellCommand, or CombinedOutputShellCommand for one-shot commands, or
// use StartShellCommand and defer TerminateShellCommandGroup immediately after
// a successful start when the caller needs manual pipe handling. If a parser
// reads stdout/stderr until EOF, the goroutine that owns Wait should terminate
// the group when the leader exits so inherited pipe holders cannot wedge the
// parser.
//
// Apply this to every long-lived subprocess no-slop spawns on behalf of a
// cancellable step/agent invocation.

// instant the leader dies the kernel rewrites its children's ppid to 1 and
// reparents them to launchd or init, which erases the only trail back to this
// command. A walk performed afterwards has nothing to follow.
//
// The group kill still runs first among the signals because it is one syscall
// that handles the common case. The tree walk is what catches a descendant that
// called setsid() and left the group, which is the case the group kill provably
// cannot reach.
// This path deliberately runs no process listing of its own. Snapshots are the
// poller's job (tracker_unix.go), because a listing here would cost tens of
// milliseconds on every command teardown - including every short git subprocess
// - and would be too late to help anyway once the leader has exited. When
// nothing escaped, which is the overwhelmingly common case, this is a single

	// leader's start time is re-verified first. The window here is smaller than
	// for a persisted record but it is not small: a step can run for well over an

// counterpart to cmd.Cancel: callers defer it right after a successful Start so
// the group is reaped however Run returns - clean exit, parse error, or
// wait error - not only on context cancellation.
//
// Why this matters: Setpgid puts each agent/command in its own group, but a
// test runner's worker pool, a build watcher, or a dev server the agent spawned
// can outlive the leader. On a normal exit nothing signals the group, so those
// grandchildren reparent to init and keep running (and keep their memory). They
// accumulate across runs until the host is out of memory, at which point the OS
// OOM-killer reaps processes - including the daemon - with an uncatchable
// SIGKILL, surfacing as "daemon crashed during execution". Reaping the group on
// every exit path closes that leak so the test step can never take the daemon
// down.
//
// It is safe to call unconditionally after Wait: the group persists only while
// a member is alive, so when the leader exited cleanly with no survivors the
// kill is a harmless no-op (ESRCH). A nil or never-started command is a no-op.
//
// By the time this runs the leader is already dead, so a live snapshot can no
// longer link anything back to it - the kernel has rewritten its children's ppid
// to 1. What makes this path work is the descendant union the poller accumulated
// while the leader was still alive; see tracker_unix.go. Calling it twice is
// harmless: the union is consumed on the first call.
