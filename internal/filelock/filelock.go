// Package filelock provides a small advisory whole-file lock used to serialize
// read-modify-write cycles on shared JSON state under NS_HOME across
// processes. It is the single owner of the OS locking primitive so callers do
// not each carry their own platform split.
//
// This is not the daemon singleton lock: that one is held for a process
// lifetime and is what prevents two daemons owning one root (see
// internal/daemon/lock.go). These locks are short-lived and released as soon
// as the state file has been rewritten.
