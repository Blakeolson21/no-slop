// without signalling real pids.
var reapProcTreeRecordFunc = proctree.ReapRecord

// reapOrphanedProcessTrees kills process trees left running by a crashed
// predecessor daemon and deletes their records.
//
// It covers the gap reapOrphanedServers does not: that function only knows about
// long-lived managed servers (opencode, rovodev) that write a PID file of their
// own. Nothing tracked the subprocesses a step or agent spawned, so a test
// runner's workers could outlive their run, their daemon, and every daemon
// after it. In gate run 01KY36EAXX53WZSEC4ZYSMY4F0 six such processes were still
// burning ~50% CPU each three days later.
//
// Safety rules, matching reapOrphanedServers:
//   - If another daemon is alive, skip everything. The daemon is machine-wide,
//     so its running steps own live process trees that must not be killed.
//   - ReapRecord itself refuses to touch a tree whose leader is still alive with
//     a matching start time, verifies each descendant before a per-pid kill, and
//     verifies each sampled group leader before a group kill. Unsampled or
//     recycled group leaders fail closed.
